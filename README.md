README

What you'll need:
 - a ruler
 - ~ 40 minutes


Please make sure that you have MATLAB, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, and Psychtoolbox-3 (http://psychtoolbox.org/download.html) installed, and that you have downloaded/cloned the 'EmotionDiscriminationTask' directory, 
and saved it to a folder. 

The directory should contain the following:

experimentLauncher.m
main.m
loadParams.m
helpers(folder)

Before beginning, measure and note the height and width of your monitor in cm, as well as 
the distance from which you will be viewing it. 


To begin the experiment, add the 'EmotionDiscriminationTask' directory to the MATLAB path and 
run 'experimentLauncher.m'.


Task description: 
On each trial, a face will briefly appear on the screen. Then, you'll be asked to decide
whether the face was ANGRY or HAPPY, using the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard to respond.
You will have 2 seconds to do this. You will then we asked to indicate how CONFIDENT you were in
your judgement, using the 1, 2, and 3 number keys (RT = 3 sec). 

The run consists of 280 trials, spread over 6 blocks. You will have a short break every 3-4 minutes, 
and the run will take about 25 min in total.
